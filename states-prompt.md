I am maintaining a list of 'active' and 'past' online sportsbooks for each US state where online sports betting is legal. 'active' books are live and accepting wagers. 'past' books are sportsbooks that used to be active in the state, but now are no longer active whether due to closing or being acquired.

I have attached a JSON file that has an active and inactive list for each state. I need you to conduct reserach and report back to me with:

1. Additions - any sportsbook which you have determined is active in a specific state, but is not present in my list of active books for that state
2. Inactives - any sportsbook which I have listed as 'active' for a state, but you have found that it is no longer active in that state. For these state as best you can the succinct reason it's no longer active, and as accurate as you can determine, the date at which it closed down.

Report your data back to me like this:

Additions:
<state name> - <sportsbook name>

<source urls>

Inactives:
<state name> - <sportsbook name> - <reason> - <date>

<source urls>

# State sources

Some states maintain a list of active sportsbooks online. Below are sources that should be checked.

CO - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10U_66tIi87Et38MplUEUTS39EvnEghVzP3gZd2tDAXI/edit?gid=1190930214#gid=1190930214

# Other notes

I'm only interested in the names of the end sportsbooks and not the license holders that operate the books. e.g. you would report to me "BetRivers" instead of "Rush Street Interactive".
